            Hey everyone, I'm <span className="purple">Vikram Singh </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Satna, India.</span>
            <br />I graduated from Lakshmi Narain College of Technology, Bhopal, with a B.Tech degree. 
            Currently, I'm working as a <span className="purple"> Software Engineer </span>at <span className="purple">Persistent Systems Limited.</span>
            <br />
              In my role, I contribute to an exciting Ecommerce project where I primarily work with React for frontend development. Additionally, I specialize in performance and load testing using tools like k6 and Webdriver.io.
            <br />
              <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
